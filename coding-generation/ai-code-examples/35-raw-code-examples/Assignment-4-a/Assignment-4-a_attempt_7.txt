Sure, I can help with that. Let's start by reading the script and understanding the scenario.

**Script:**
A projectile is launched at an angle $\theta$ with initial velocity $v_0$. The equations of motion for the projectile are:




Given $v_0 = 125 \, \text{m/s}$, $g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2$, and $\theta = \{30^\circ, 45^\circ, 60^\circ, 75^\circ\}$, where $\theta$ is measured in radians.

::: Task ::::

Based on the information provided in the script, we need to calculate the following two variables:
1. Range of the projectile
2. Maximum height reached by the projectile

Let's start by defining the necessary constants for the simulation, and then we can calculate the range and the maximum height.
