**Projectile Motion Simulation**

*Script:*
A projectile is launched with an initial velocity of 125 m/s at an angle of 30 degrees above the horizontal. We will simulate the trajectory of the projectile considering air resistance. 

*Constants:*
- Initial velocity, \( v_0 = 125 \, \text{m/s} \)
- Launch angle, \( \theta = 30^{\circ} \)
- Acceleration due to gravity, \( g = 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)
- Air resistance constant, \( k = 0.1 \)

*Simulation:*
1. Calculate the horizontal and vertical components of the initial velocity.
2. Update the position and velocity of the projectile at each time step using the equations of motion with air resistance.
3. Repeat until the projectile hits the ground (i.e., \( y < 0 \)).

::: Task :::
Create a plot to show the trajectories for different values of the initial angle. Use the same velocity \( v_0=125\rm{m/s} \) for all angles. The plot should have axis labels and a title. [4 marks
