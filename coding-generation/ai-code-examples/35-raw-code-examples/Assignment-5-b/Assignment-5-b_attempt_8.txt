The script provided is a template for simulating the decay of three types of atoms ('A', 'B', 'C') over time. It defines functions to handle transitions between atom types based on their respective half-lives and transition probabilities.

The main task is to complete the implementation by defining the transition probabilities and rules for the system evolution. This involves implementing functions to check if a transition occurs, update the state based on transition rules, and evolve the system over multiple time steps.

After completing the missing parts in the script, the next step is to run the simulation multiple times, collect the results for the number of 'A' atoms at each time step, calculate the average and uncertainty, and create a plot showing the evolution of 'A' atoms over time.

Finally, the plot should show the average number of 'A' atoms with error bars representing the uncertainty calculated from the 20 simulation runs.

Let's proceed with implementing the missing parts in the script
