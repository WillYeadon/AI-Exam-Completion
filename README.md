This is a collection of code I've used to create various AI benchmarking tests. In general there are two parts, an API script to generate AI answers to various questions students are assigned during physics modules and utility code to turn those answers into PDFs that can be marked blinded. 

Here are some preprints looking at physics essays [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05458), physics written exams [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15609) and physics coding assignments [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16977). 

The same code was used to look at Old English Essays [here](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3483059/v1) If you're interested at doing this at your own institution please feel free to contact me for more details.
