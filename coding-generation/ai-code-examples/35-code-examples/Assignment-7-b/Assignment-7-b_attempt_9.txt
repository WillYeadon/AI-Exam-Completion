::: Task :::

Explore the impact of different step sizes on the optimization trajectory of the gradient descent algorithm when applied to the banana function.

Objective:
1. Using the provided plot `im = plt.imshow(data, ...`, populate `data` with the values of the banana function, creating a backdrop for your trajectories.
2. Using only the functions defined above, create a series of trajectories using different step sizes, denoted as `etas`, to observe their effect on the convergence paths of the algorithm.
3. Start all trajectories from the point r_0 = (0.2,1).
4. Use plt.plot to plot the trajectories on the same figure as `im = plt.imshow(data, ...`
5. Ensure your plot includes labels, a descriptive title, and a legend to differentiate between trajectories for each step size
